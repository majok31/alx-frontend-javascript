This project is part of the curriculum at ALX and it focuses on ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) concepts and syntax. The project consists of multiple tasks, each requiring modifications or implementations of JavaScript functions using ES6 features such as const, let, arrow functions, default parameters, rest parameters, spread syntax, template literals, computed property names, method properties, and more.
